> Normal javascript code executes on a single thread in the resident html file. If the html file is closed, that code/thread 
  becomes inactive/ inaccessible.
> service workers run in a separate thread than other js-code. 
  >> if initialized in the root index html file, they will be accessible to all application.
  >> they can then globally listen to events and respond to them
  >> they run in background
  >> they are alive even after the browser/app is closed.
  
> "Listenable" events of a service worker
  >> Fetch:- Browser/page-js initiates a fetch (http request). Note that if using libraries like axios, etc., this fetch 
     would not be initiated; otherwise fetch can be initiated.
  >> Push Notifications:- Service workers receive Web Push Notifications (from Server). 
     Server -> Browser Server -> app receives push notification (?)
  >> Notification Interaction:
     - user interacts with the notification
  >> Background Sync:
     - SW receives Background Sync Event (eg. internet is restored)
  >> Service Worker Life Cycle
     - Service Worker live cycle events.
